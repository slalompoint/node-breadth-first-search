# Node Breadth First Search

Supporting material for the blog post: http://www.slalompoint.com/node-breadth-first-search/

## To run example:

```$ node main.js

## Set search root directory: 

Inside main.js:

```$ bfs.setroot('temp');


This repo demonstrates a breadth first search implementation in the context of file searching within a Node.js app.

The 'temp' directory provides a few files to test the algorithm. It otherwise has no other purpose.
